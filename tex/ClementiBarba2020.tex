    Credibility building activities in computational research include
    verification and validation, reproducibility and replication, and
    uncertainty quantification. Though orthogonal to each other, they are
    related. This paper presents validation and replication studies in 
    electromagnetic excitations on nanoscale structures, where the quantity
    of interest is the wavelength at which resonance peaks occur. 
    The study uses the open-source software PyGBe: a boundary element
    solver with trecode acceleration and GPU capability.
    We replicate a result by Rockstuhl et al. (2005, doi:10/dsxw9d) with a
    two-dimensional boundary element method on silicon carbide particles,
    despite differences in our method. 
    The second replication case from Ellis et al. (2016, doi:10/f83zcb) looks
    at aspect ratio effects on high-order modes of localized surface phonon-polariton
    nanostructures. The results partially replicate: the wavenumber
    position of some mode match, but for other modes they differ.
    With virtually no information about the original simulations, 
    explaining the discrepancies is not possible. 
    A comparison with experiments that measured polarized reflectance 
    of silicon carbide nano pillars provides a validation case.
    The wavenumber of the dominant mode and two more do match, but 
    differences remain in other minor modes.

\section{Introduction}

Some fields of research, particularly solid mechanics and computational fluid dynamics, have a long tradition of community consensus building and established practices for verification and validation of computational models. 
Such practices are uncommon in other fields of science, especially if they have more recently become computationally intensive.
Verification and validation also become increasingly difficult when the computational models arise from many levels of mathematical and physical modeling, representing a complex system. 
In recent years, science as a whole has come to be concerned with reproducibility and replication as a new front in the continual campaign to build confidence on published findings. 
Together with formal processes of uncertainty quantification, we have now three complementary ``axes'' to building trust in science. 

The lengths to which research communities should go to conduct activities in verification and validation, reproducibility and replication, and uncertainty quantification, are highly debated. 
Some journals require articles reporting on computational results to include proof of these activities, while most do not consider these aspects at all in their review criteria. 
In this paper, we tackle a sub-field of computational physics where tradition for these confidence-building activities is scant. 
The physical setting, excitation of resonance modes in nanostructures under an electromagnetic field, relies on multiple levels of modeling, while the experimental methods are complicated by the small length scales. 
We previously developed a computational model and software (called \pygbe) that has undergone code and solution verification, but a validation opportunity had remained elusive. 
Here, we present replication studies and a validation case based on published simulation and experimental results. 
Moreover, the studies in this paper were conducted under rigorous reproducibility practices, and all digital artifacts needed to reproduce every figure are shared in reproducibility packages available in a GitHub repository and archival services.
